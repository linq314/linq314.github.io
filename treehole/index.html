<p>

	If I could have just one more day and 
<br>wishes did come true,
<br>I'd spend every glorious moment
<br>side by side with you.
<br>Recalling all the years we shared
<br>and memories we made,
<br>how grateful I would be
<br>to have just one more day.
<br>Where the tears I've shed are 
<br>not in vain and only fall in bliss,
<br>so many things I'd let you know
<br>about the days you've missed.
<br>I wouldn't have to make pretend
<br>you never went away,
<br>how grateful I would be to
<br>have just one more day.
<br>When that day came to a close
<br>and the sun began to set,
<br>a million times I'd let you know
<br>I never will forget.  
<br>The heart of gold you left behind
<br>when you entered Heaven's gate,
<br>how grateful I would be to
<br>have just one more day.
